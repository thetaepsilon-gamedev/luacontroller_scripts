# luacontroller scripts: lua scripts for the mesecons luacontroller

A collection of scripts for use with the luacontroller in the minetest mod mesecons.
Please read the comment blocks at the top of each script to see it's functionality.
To use, open of these files in a text editor then copy-paste the contents into a luacontroller in-game.
The comment blocks may indicate that you need to adjust certain tables to customise the behaviour.

All of these scripts are public domain (see the LICENSE file)
so you may copy-paste them into controllers to your heart's content;
go forth and hack (no, not the malicious kind of hacking).

Also note, many of these will likely require digilines;
the comment blocks in the scripts will indicate this.
These scripts will likely not work as intended if you do not have digilines installed.
